# Interactive-Dictionary
This is an interactive English Dictionary CLI app using python.
The code for this program is inspired from the Udemy’s Python Mega Course

There are two data sources included in the script. We could use either of them.

	data.json—> Is the file from the udemy course
	dictionary.json-—> is the webster dictionary, i found from adambom’s repo in github

The data is not generated by me, so please don’t blame me for the response from the the dictionary :p
